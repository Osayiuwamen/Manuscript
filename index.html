        <h1>Graphic Design Criticism <br>
            as a Spectator Sport</h1>
        <span>Part Two</span>
        <p class="secondary-text">Everybody Wants to Go to Harvard</p>
        <p>Earlier last year, the University of California quietly unveiled a new logo. Much has changed since 2009,
            including the notion that you can quietly unveil a logo. The logo was, eventually,
            inevitably noticed.
        </p>
        <p>After Tropicana, after the "epic fail" Gap debacle, after the seizure-inducing London 2012 affair, no one
            should have been surprised by what happened next. In fact, you almost had a sense that we all knew our roles
            in the drama to come: New logo? Game on! Graphic design criticism is now a spectator sport, and anyone can
            play.</p>
        <p class="Red-middletext">Creating a beautiful design is just the first step in a long and challenging process
            with
            no guarantee of success. Users hardly welcome change, but as a designer, you can assure your audience that
            the new change will grow on them. In other words, you must sell it by educating our audience to understand
            the process and context of the change.</p>
        <p>The review on Brand New, Armin Vit's amazingly popular logo review website, was mixed. The new UC logo was
            contemporary and abstract, and sat at the center of a smart and attractive new visual system, a very
            professional job by the University's in-house design team.
        <p>Significantly, it was meant to represent the University of California system, the holding company,
            in effect, for UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and the other schools in the network. All of them would keep
            their existing logos. Brand New commenters tend to be other graphic designers. Some liked it,
            some didn't.</p>
        <p>There was no such ambivalence on the part of the UC community of students, faculty and alumni. They basically
            went crazy with rage. A petition on Change.org — "Stop the new UC logo" — got over 54,000 signatures. </p>
        <p>The outcry spread to the general press coverage, who called it "one of the worst logo rebrands
            in history", "revolting" and "a fiasco." Some in the graphic design community attempted to rally around the
            embattled designers, including Armin Vit, who wrote a none-too-subtle response to the critics that included
            the suggestion: "Shut up. Seriously. Shut up."</p>
        <p>The University held their ground for a week or so before capitulating. Said Daniel M. Dooley, UC's senior
            vice president for external relations: "While I believe the design element in question" — you can almost
            hear him choking on the word logo — "would win wide acceptance over time, it also
            is important that we listen to and respect what has been a significant negative response by students, alumni
            and other members of our community." "Pleasant news," said the opponents.
            "Awesome victory."</p>

        <p>The reading from Graphic Design Criticism as a Spectator Sport fit into the canon of design as a whole
            because it
            explained how the audience reacts to design changes and how the users are significant figures in design.
            Creating a
            beautiful design is just the first step in a long and challenging process with no guarantee of success.
            "Design is a
            process, not a product."</p>
        <p>I agree with the author's statement that graphic design criticism is a spectator sport. Here is my favourite
            quote.
            "Pretty pictures can no longer lead the way in which our visual environment should be shaped. It is time to
            debate, to
            probe the values, to examine the theories that are part of our heritage and to verify their validity to
            express our
            times."</p>
        <p>This reading holds up to the contemporary practice of interaction design because the author highlighted how
            people
            prefer complicated logo designs to simple ones as well as literal things to metaphors. Also, people now
            prefer the thing
            they are used to rather than the new thing you are pushing on them.</p>
        <p>In the contemporary interaction design practice, the writer's second and third points are evident. For
            example, users
            interacting with an interface are wired in such a way that they assume what a button should do, and if it
            does not, the
            user sees the product as bad.
            The author said something very interesting: "New logo? Game on! Graphic design criticism
            is now a spectator sport, and anyone can play." which is 100% Valid in interaction design.</p>
